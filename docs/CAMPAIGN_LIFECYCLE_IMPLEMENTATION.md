## CLM-01: Data Surface Audit & Schema Updates

### Current State Analysis (2025-11-01)

#### 1. Files and Databases Referencing Campaigns

| File/Directory | Has campaign_id? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `models/campaigns.json` | Yes (keys) | Campaign profiles with settings |
| `models/parties.json` | Partial | Party configs, no direct campaign link |
| `models/knowledge/*.json` | Yes | Has campaign_id field |
| `models/character_profiles/*.json` | Partial | Supports campaign_id field (migration in progress) |
| `output/*/*/*_data.json` | Yes | Metadata includes campaign_id for new outputs |
| `logs/session_status.json` | Yes | Status tracker stores campaign_id |
| `src/character_profile.py` | Yes | ProfileUpdateBatch has campaign_id |
| `output/*/narratives/*.md` | Partial | Campaign metadata available via narrative helpers |
| `output/imported_narratives/*.md` | Partial | Campaign metadata pending |

#### 2. Data Structures Needing Campaign ID

**High Priority (P0):**
- [DONE] `models/knowledge/*.json` - Already has campaign_id
- [DONE] `output/*/*/*_data.json` - Session metadata includes campaign_id (new runs)
- [DONE] `logs/session_status.json` - Status tracker stores campaign_id
- [DONE] Character profiles store campaign_id (migration helper available)

**Medium Priority (P1):**
- [LATER] `models/parties.json` - Parties remain campaign-agnostic (campaign references party_id)
- [PLANNED] Narrative files - Campaign metadata to be embedded via narrative formatter
- [DONE] Story notebook manager - Campaign filtering ready via list_sessions(campaign_id=...)

**Low Priority (P2):**
- [TBD] Speaker profiles (if we add campaign-specific speaker models)
- [TBD] Checkpoint data (for resume functionality)

#### 3. Schema Change Details

##### 3.1 Session Output Metadata (`*_data.json`)

**Current:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "test_ui_5min",
    "input_file": "...",
    "character_names": [...],
    "player_names": [...],
    "statistics": {...}
  }
}
```

**Proposed:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "test_ui_5min",
    "campaign_id": "broken_seekers",  // NEW
    "campaign_name": "The Broken Seekers",  // NEW (optional, for display)
    "party_id": "default",  // NEW
    "input_file": "...",
    "character_names": [...],
    "player_names": [...],
    "statistics": {...}
  }
}
```

**Reasoning:** Session outputs are the core artifact of processing. Adding campaign_id here enables:
- Filtering sessions by campaign in UI tabs
- Correct knowledge base updates
- Session history tracking per campaign

**Migration Strategy:** Add fields with `null` default for legacy sessions. Provide migration CLI command to backfill.

##### 3.2 Status Tracker (`logs/session_status.json`)

**Current:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "test_5min_quick",
  "processing": false,
  "status": "failed",
  "options": {
    "party_id": null,
    ...
  }
}
```

**Proposed:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "test_5min_quick",
  "campaign_id": "broken_seekers",  // NEW
  "processing": false,
  "status": "failed",
  "options": {
    "campaign_id": "broken_seekers",  // NEW (duplicate for convenience)
    "party_id": "default",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Reasoning:** Status tracker shows real-time progress. Campaign context enables:
- App Manager to show "Campaign XYZ is processing"
- Diagnostics tab to filter by active campaign
- Prevention of concurrent processing of different campaigns (optional feature)

**Migration Strategy:** No migration needed (status.json is transient, overwritten each session).

##### 3.3 Character Profiles

**Current:**
```json
{
  "name": "Sha'ek Mindfa'ek",
  "campaign": "Gaia Adventures - Culdor Academy",  // Text field
  "player": "Player1",
  ...
}
```

**Proposed:**
```json
{
  "name": "Sha'ek Mindfa'ek",
  "campaign_id": "broken_seekers",  // NEW
  "campaign_name": "Gaia Adventures - Culdor Academy",  // RENAMED from "campaign"
  "player": "Player1",
  ...
}
```

**Reasoning:**
- Current `campaign` field is free text and not linked to actual campaigns
- Adding `campaign_id` enables proper filtering and validation
- Renaming to `campaign_name` preserves display value

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Add `campaign_id` field (default: first matching campaign or `null`)
2. Rename existing `campaign` -> `campaign_name`
3. Provide migration helper to map profiles to campaigns

##### 3.4 Party Configuration

**Current:**
```json
{
  "default": {
    "party_name": "The Broken Seekers",
    "dm_name": "DM",
    "characters": [...],
    "campaign": "Gaia Adventures",  // Text field, not linked
    "notes": "..."
  }
}
```

**Proposed - Option A (Recommended):**
```json
{
  "default": {
    "party_name": "The Broken Seekers",
    "dm_name": "DM",
    "characters": [...],
    "campaign_ids": ["broken_seekers", "side_quest_01"],  // NEW: Many-to-many
    "notes": "..."
  }
}
```

**Proposed - Option B (Simpler):**
Keep parties independent, campaigns reference party_id (current approach).

**Decision:** Use **Option B** (current approach). Campaigns already reference `party_id`. This maintains single source of truth (Campaign owns the relationship).

**Migration Strategy:** No change needed to parties.json structure.

##### 3.5 Narrative Files

**Current:**
```markdown
# Session 1 - The Storm's Aftermath

[Content...]
```

**Proposed:**
```markdown
---
campaign_id: broken_seekers
campaign_name: The Broken Seekers
session_id: Session_01
generated_at: 2025-10-22T13:49:53Z
---

# Session 1 - The Storm's Aftermath

[Content...]
```

**Reasoning:** YAML frontmatter enables:
- Programmatic filtering of narratives by campaign
- [DONE] Story notebook manager - Campaign filtering ready via list_sessions(campaign_id=...)
- Export tools to bundle campaign materials

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Add frontmatter to new narratives
2. Provide CLI tool to add frontmatter to existing files based on knowledge base or user input

#### 4. Migration Strategy Summary

**Phase 1: Non-Breaking Additions (Week 1)**
- [DONE] Add `campaign_id` parameter to pipeline entry points
- [DONE] Add `campaign_id` to new session metadata
- [DONE] Add `campaign_id` to status tracker
- [DONE] Update formatter to include campaign metadata

**Phase 2: Character Profile Migration (Week 1)**
- [DONE] Add migration helper: `cli.py campaigns migrate-profiles`
- [DONE] Add `campaign_id` field to character profile schema
- [DONE] Update CharacterProfileManager to support campaign filtering

**Phase 3: Narrative Migration (Week 2)**
- [DONE] Add migration helper: `cli.py campaigns migrate-narratives`
- [DONE] Update StoryNotebookManager to write frontmatter
- [DONE] Update narrative generation to include campaign metadata

**Phase 4: Legacy Session Backfill (Optional)**
- [DONE] Provide tool to add `campaign_id` to existing `*_data.json` files
- [DONE] This is optional - legacy sessions can remain without campaign_id
- Tool: `python cli.py campaigns migrate-sessions <campaign_id>`

#### 5. Code Changes Required

**Files to Modify:**

1. **`src/formatter.py`**
   - `format_json()`: Add `campaign_id`, `campaign_name`, `party_id` to metadata
   - Pass campaign context from pipeline

2. **`src/status_tracker.py`**
   - Add `campaign_id` field to status structure
   - Update `update_status()` to accept and store campaign_id

3. **`src/character_profile.py`**
   - Add `campaign_id` field to `CharacterProfile` dataclass
   - Add `get_profiles_by_campaign()` method to `CharacterProfileManager`
   - Update save/load to handle new field

4. **`src/story_notebook.py`**
   - Update narrative generation to include YAML frontmatter
   - Add `get_narratives_by_campaign()` method
   - Update `StoryNotebookManager` to filter by campaign

5. **`cli.py`**
   - Add `campaigns migrate-profiles` command
   - Add `campaigns migrate-narratives` command
   - Add `campaigns migrate-sessions` command (optional)

6. **Pipeline entry points** (wherever sessions are started):
   - Accept `campaign_id` parameter
   - Pass to formatter, status tracker, knowledge base

#### 6. Implementation Notes & Decisions

**Decision Log:**

1. **Q: Should we store campaign_id or campaign object in metadata?**
   - **A:** Store `campaign_id` (string) only. Campaign details can be looked up from `campaigns.json`. This prevents data duplication and ensures single source of truth.
   - **Reasoning:** If campaign name/settings change, we don't want stale data in every session file.

2. **Q: What about sessions processed before campaigns existed?**
   - **A:** Allow `campaign_id: null` in metadata. Provide migration tools but don't force migration.
   - **Reasoning:** Users may have test sessions or old data they don't want to associate with any campaign.

3. **Q: Should character profiles be campaign-specific or global?**
   - **A:** Campaign-specific. Same character name in different campaigns should be separate profiles.
   - **Reasoning:** "Gandalf" in a Tolkien campaign is different from "Gandalf" in a parody campaign.

4. **Q: How to handle party-campaign relationship?**
   - **A:** Campaign owns the relationship (has `party_id`). Parties remain independent.
   - **Reasoning:** Same party could theoretically be used across campaigns (e.g., one-shots with same characters).

5. **Q: Should we version campaign schemas for future migrations?**
   - **A:** YES. Add `"schema_version": "1.0"` to campaigns.json
   - **Reasoning:** As recommended in implementation plan, this enables future migrations.

**Follow-Up Questions from Plan:**
- [DONE] **Should campaign metadata include a version to support future schema migrations?**
  - YES - Add `schema_version` field to campaigns.json and profile files

- [PAUSED] **Do we need soft-delete/archival support for campaigns?**
  - NOT YET - Can add in future if users request it. For now, deletion is permanent.

## Implementation Progress

### Completed (2025-11-01)

#### CLM-01: Data Audit [DONE]
- Catalogued all files/databases referencing campaigns
- Defined schema changes for metadata, status tracker, character profiles
- Documented migration strategy and backward compatibility approach
- Recorded design decisions and rationale

#### CLM-A2: Pipeline Output Metadata [DONE]
**Files Modified:**
- `src/pipeline.py`:
  - Added `self.campaign_id` instance variable (line 91)
  - Updated metadata dict to include `campaign_id`, `campaign_name`, `party_id` (lines 715-724)
  - Fixed knowledge extraction to use campaign_id (line 845)
  - Updated docstring to document campaign_id parameter

- `src/status_tracker.py`:
  - Added `campaign_id` parameter to `start_session()` method (line 112)
  - Store campaign_id in status JSON (line 145)
  - Updated caller in pipeline to pass campaign_id (line 226)

**What This Enables:**
- All new session outputs include campaign metadata in `*_data.json`
- Status tracker shows which campaign is being processed
- Knowledge base correctly associates sessions with campaigns
- Backward compatible (campaign_id can be None for legacy/manual sessions)

#### CLM-A3: Character Profile Campaign Support [DONE]
**Files Modified:**
- `src/character_profile.py`:
  - Added `campaign_id` field to `CharacterProfile` dataclass (line 180)
  - Renamed `campaign` -> `campaign_name` for clarity (line 181)
  - Added automatic migration in `_parse_profile_data()` (lines 258-265)
  - Added `get_profiles_by_campaign()` method for filtering (lines 374-387)
  - Updated `list_characters()` to accept optional campaign_id filter (lines 354-372)

**Migration Behavior:**
- On load, automatically converts old `campaign` field -> `campaign_name`
- Adds `campaign_id: null` for legacy profiles
- Non-destructive: changes only saved when profile is updated
- Backward compatible: old files still load correctly

**Tested:**
- Loaded 4 existing profiles successfully
- Verified migration of "Gaia Adventures - Culdor Academy" -> campaign_name
- Verified campaign_id field added with null value
- Re-saved profile has correct schema

#### CLM-A4: Migration Helper Tools [DONE]
**Files Created:**
- `src/campaign_migration.py` (317 lines):
  - `MigrationReport` dataclass for tracking results
  - `CampaignMigration` class with three migration methods:
    - `migrate_session_metadata()` - adds campaign_id to session JSON files
    - `migrate_character_profiles()` - assigns campaign_id to character profiles
    - `migrate_narrative_frontmatter()` - adds YAML frontmatter to narratives
  - All methods support dry-run mode and filtering
  - Non-destructive: skips files already migrated
  - Detailed reporting with session/profile counts and errors

- `tests/test_campaign_migration.py` (443 lines):
  - 9 comprehensive tests covering all migration scenarios:
    - Dry-run vs actual execution
    - Skip logic for already-migrated data
    - Glob pattern filtering for sessions
    - Character list filtering for profiles
    - Markdown report generation
  - **All tests passing** [DONE]

- `docs/CAMPAIGN_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` (386 lines):
  - Complete user-facing migration guide
  - Step-by-step workflows with examples
  - Before/after data comparisons
  - Troubleshooting section and FAQ
  - Best practices and migration checklist

**CLI Commands Added** (`cli.py` lines 636-767):
```bash
# Migrate session metadata
python cli.py campaigns migrate-sessions <campaign_id> [--dry-run] [--filter PATTERN] [--output FILE]

# Migrate character profiles
python cli.py campaigns migrate-profiles <campaign_id> [--dry-run] [--characters NAME1,NAME2] [--output FILE]

# Migrate narrative files
python cli.py campaigns migrate-narratives <campaign_id> [--dry-run] [--output FILE]
```

**Features:**
- Interactive prompts for confirmation before actual migration
- Rich console output with color-coded status
- Optional markdown report export
- Glob pattern filtering for sessions (e.g., "Session_*")
- Character name filtering for selective profile migration
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Test Results:**
```
tests/test_campaign_migration.py::test_migrate_session_metadata_dry_run PASSED
tests/test_campaign_migration.py::test_migrate_session_metadata_actual PASSED
tests/test_campaign_migration.py::test_migrate_session_metadata_skip_existing PASSED
tests/test_campaign_migration.py::test_migrate_session_metadata_with_filter PASSED

tests/test_campaign_migration.py::test_migrate_narrative_skip_with_frontmatter PASSED
tests/test_campaign_migration.py::test_generate_migration_report_markdown PASSED

========================= 9 passed in 0.18s =========================
```

**What This Enables:**
- Users can safely migrate existing sessions to campaigns with dry-run preview
- Character profiles can be bulk-assigned to campaigns
- [PLANNED] Narrative files - Campaign metadata to be embedded via narrative formatter
- Detailed reports help track migration progress
- Non-destructive operations prevent data loss

#### CLM-05: Tab-Level Campaign Filtering (Backend) [LOOP]
**Status**: Campaign Lifecycle Manager Complete

**Files Modified:**
- `src/story_notebook.py`:
  - Added `campaign_id` and `include_unassigned` parameters to `list_sessions()` (lines 35-88)
  - Enhanced `build_session_info()` to display campaign assignment status (lines 103-147)
  - Graceful degradation for legacy sessions without campaign_id
  - Comprehensive docstrings documenting filtering behavior

**Files Created:**
- `tests/test_story_notebook_campaign_filtering.py` (10 tests, all passing):
  - Test filtering by campaign_id
  - Test include/exclude unassigned sessions
  - Test limit parameter with filtering
  - Test session info display with/without campaign
  - Test error handling (empty dirs, corrupted files)

- `docs/CLM-05_TAB_FILTERING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (detailed implementation guide):
  - Backend implementation documentation
  - Design patterns and best practices
  - Remaining UI work breakdown
  - Migration path for users
  - Performance considerations

**Features Implemented:**
- **Campaign Filtering**: `list_sessions(campaign_id="my_campaign")` returns only matching sessions
- **Graceful Degradation**: `include_unassigned=True` (default) shows legacy sessions in all campaign views
- **Strict Filtering**: `include_unassigned=False` shows only explicitly assigned sessions
- **Campaign Display**: Session info shows campaign assignment with migration hint for unassigned

**What This Enables:**
- Backend ready for UI integration - tabs can filter sessions by campaign
- Backward compatible with legacy sessions (no breaking changes)
- Users can see which sessions belong to which campaign
- Clear path for incremental migration (unassigned sessions visible until migrated)

**UI Integration Status** (Updated 2025-11-02):
- [DONE] Character Profiles tab - Campaign selector added (2 tests)
- [DONE] LLM Chat tab - Campaign-filtered profiles (3 tests)
- [DONE] Story Notebook tab - Campaign selector and session filtering (3 tests)
- [DONE] Social Insights tab - Campaign selector wiring and analytics reset (2 tests)

**Completion**: 4 of 4 tabs complete, 18 tests passing (10 backend + 8 UI)
See [CLM-05_TAB_FILTERING_IMPLEMENTATION.md](CLM-05_TAB_FILTERING_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for details.

## Implementation Notes & Reasoning (2025-11-02)

1. **Campaign Launcher & State Propagation**
   - **Choice**: Replaced the placeholder hero section in `app.py` with a campaign launcher that exposes load/create actions, campaign manifest, and shared state via `gr.State`.
   - **Reasoning**: Centralises campaign selection and ensures every tab receives consistent updates when the active campaign changes.
   - **Trade-offs**: Removes the earlier hero branding in favour of functional controls; modern styling remains to be iterated.

2. **Process Tab Modernisation**
   - **Choice**: Rebuilt `create_process_session_tab_modern` to call the real pipeline, preload campaign defaults, and surface campaign status badges.
   - **Reasoning**: Aligns modern UI with working pipeline behaviour while keeping the wizard flow.
   - **Trade-offs**: Batch processing and advanced layout elements are temporarily omitted until design catches up.

3. **Tab-Level Campaign Filtering**
   - **Choice**: Simplified campaign, characters, stories, and settings tabs to data-driven markdown summaries fed by new helper functions in `app.py`.
   - **Reasoning**: Ensures end-to-end campaign awareness today, trading flashy cards for correct behaviour.
   - **Trade-offs**: Visual richness was reduced; future iterations can reintroduce grids once datasets are wired.

4. **Helper Utilities & Tests**
   - **Choice**: Added helper renderers (campaign overviews, knowledge snippets, session listings) with unit coverage in `tests/test_campaign_ui_helpers.py`.
   - **Reasoning**: Keeps presentation logic testable and documents expectations for future UI work.
   - **Trade-offs**: Tests rely on existing fixture data; deeper fixtures may be required for edge cases later.

5. **Social Insights Synchronisation**
   - **Choice**: Routed campaign selections into the Social Insights tab so dropdowns, keyword prompts, and nebula outputs reset with the active campaign.
   - **Reasoning**: Prevents stale analytics from previous campaigns and keeps the reporting workflow aligned with the launcher.
   - **Trade-offs**: Currently refreshes the nebula visual on every campaign switch; future optimisation could cache recent renders.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Capture user feedback from early CLM runs and adjust campaign defaults as needed.
- [ ] Align with P2.1 polish work (UX and testing) to extend campaign coverage in LangChain flows.
- [ ] Plan analytics enhancements that build on the new campaign manifest (dashboards, OOC topics).
- [ ] Refactor campaign selector into a shared UI state so tabs no longer keep duplicated per-tab selectors.
