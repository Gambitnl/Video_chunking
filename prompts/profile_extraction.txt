# Profile Extraction Prompt Template

## Purpose
Describe the desired instructions for the language model when extracting character-specific updates from a session transcript. This file will be refined alongside the `ProfileExtractor` implementation.

## Template Variables
- `{{character_names}}`: Comma separated list of known PCs
- `{{campaign_name}}`: Campaign identifier/name
- `{{transcript_excerpt}}`: IC-only transcript chunk

## Outline
1. Summarize critical character actions (combat, social, exploration).
2. Highlight notable quotes with speaker attribution.
3. Capture relationship changes or emotional beats between characters.
4. Identify inventory changes (items gained/lost) and goal progress.
5. Provide context snippets (1-2 sentences) for each update.
6. Return JSON matching `schemas/profile_update.json`.
