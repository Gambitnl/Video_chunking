- Read the plan for any feature before implementing it

[DONE] **Stage 3 Complete**: You know what needs to be built

## [LOOP] The Operator Workflow Loop

**CRITICAL**: This is how ALL work is done in this repository.

```
1. START FROM THE PLAN
   |
   v Read ROADMAP.md or implementation plans before coding

2. WORK IN SMALL STEPS
   |
   v Implement one subtask at a time
   v Update plan immediately (checkboxes, notes)

3. DOCUMENT REASONING
   |
   v Add "Implementation Notes & Reasoning" as you go
   v Explain WHY, not just WHAT

4. VALIDATE CONTINUOUSLY
   |
   v Run tests after each change (pytest -q)
   v Note gaps or failures

5. REPORT WITH CONTEXT
   |
   v Reference plan sections you advanced
   v List tests executed

6. REQUEST CRITICAL REVIEW
   |
   v "Is there truly no issues with [feature]?"
   v Address findings and iterate

7. MERGE AFTER APPROVAL
   |
   v Update documentation
   â””-> Loop back to step 1 for next task
```

---

## [FOLDER] Reference: Where to Find Things

### Documentation
- **Index**: `docs/README.md` - Complete documentation index
- **All docs**: `docs/` directory

### Code

## [KEY] Key Concepts

### 1. The Processing Pipeline
```
Audio Input (M4A/MP3/WAV)
  |
  v Audio Conversion (FFmpeg -> 16kHz WAV)
  |
  v Chunking (VAD-based smart chunking)
  |
  v Transcription (faster-whisper)
  |
  v Overlap Merging
  |
  v Speaker Diarization (PyAnnote)
  |
  v IC/OOC Classification (Ollama LLM)
  |
  v Output Generation
```

### 2. Critical Reviewer Methodology
- **Skeptical by default**: Assume issues exist until proven otherwise
- **Socratic questioning**: Challenge assumptions
- **Documented reasoning**: Every decision needs a "why"
- **Learning feedback loop**: Quality compounds over time

### 3. Implementation Requirements
**All features MUST include**:
1. **Implementation Notes & Reasoning** - Design decisions, alternatives, trade-offs
2. **Code Review Findings** - Issues identified, recommendations, merge verdict
3. **Tests** - Unit tests for new code
4. **Documentation** - Update relevant docs

### 4. Priority System
- **P0**: Critical/Immediate (bugs, crashes, refactoring blockers)
- **P1**: High Impact (features that unlock major value)
- **P2**: Important Enhancements
- **P3**: Future Enhancements
- **P4**: Infrastructure & Quality

## [WARNING] Common Pitfalls

### [FAIL] Don't Do This
1. **Coding without reading the plan** -> You'll miss requirements
2. **Leaving documentation until the end** -> Context is lost
3. **Not keeping the plan in sync** -> Plan becomes stale
4. **Skipping tests** -> Bugs slip through
5. **Not requesting critical review** -> Issues ship to production

### [DONE] Do This Instead
1. **Start from the plan** -> Read before writing code
2. **Document as you go** -> Update plan after each subtask
3. **Keep plan synchronized** -> Plan is single source of truth
4. **Write tests continuously** -> Test as you go
5. **Request skeptical review** -> "Is there truly no issues?"

## [LIGHT] Philosophy

> "Quality emerges from dialogue, not perfection on first try. Every implementation deserves skeptical analysis, and every decision deserves a documented 'why'."

**Core principles**:
- **Plans are living documents** - Keep them in sync
- **Reasoning is required** - Document the "why"
- **Skepticism is professionalism** - "Revisions requested" is normal
- **Feedback loops create quality** - Review -> Document -> Learn -> Improve

**Welcome to the team!** [ROCKET]

**Next step**: Choose your first task from `ROADMAP.md` and read its implementation plan.
