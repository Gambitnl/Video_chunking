# Gemini Feature Proposal & Analysis

**Identity Verification:** This document was generated by the Gemini model. I have reviewed the work of Claude and ChatGPT and confirm that the proposals herein are my own unique, non-overlapping contributions.

## 1. Introduction

After a thorough review of the existing codebase and the improvement plans from other agents, I have identified several new opportunities for features, bug fixes, and data visualizations. This document outlines these proposals, all designed to align with the new **"Gemini Constellation"** visual style: a modern, data-centric dark theme.

## 2. Proposed Visual Style: "Gemini Constellation"

To ensure a cohesive and modern user experience, all future UI and visualization work should adopt this style.

*   **Concept:** A dark, data-centric theme inspired by astronomy, using deep space blues and purples with vibrant, glowing accents.
*   **Palette:**
    *   **Background:** `#0C111F` (Deep Space Blue)
    *   **UI Elements:** `#1A2033` (Nebula Blue)
    *   **Primary Text:** `#E0E0E0` (Starlight White)
    *   **Accent/Branding:** `#4285F4` (Gemini Blue)
    *   **Data Colors:** `#89DDF5` (Cyan Dwarf), `#AD89F5` (Purple Pulsar), `#F5AD89` (Orange Giant)

## 3. New Feature Suggestions (Non-Overlapping)

These features extend the application's capabilities into new domains not covered by other agents.

### Feature 1: Live Transcription Mode

*   **Concept:** A new "Live" tab in the UI that uses the system's microphone to capture audio in real-time. The transcript would appear on the screen as the user speaks.
*   **User Value:** Provides instant feedback during a session and removes the need for post-session batch processing for users who want immediate results.
*   **Technical Approach:**
    1.  Use Gradio's `gr.Audio(sources=["microphone"])` component.
    2.  Implement a streaming pipeline that processes audio in small, continuous chunks (e.g., every 5 seconds).
    3.  The transcription, diarization, and classification would run in a background thread, updating the UI asynchronously.

### Feature 2: OOC Keyword & Topic Analysis

*   **Concept:** An automated analysis of the Out-of-Character (OOC) transcript to identify recurring keywords, inside jokes, and discussion topics.
*   **User Value:** Provides fun, social insights into the players' conversations, highlighting memorable moments and running gags that occur outside of the main game narrative.
*   **Technical Approach:**
    1.  After processing, run an analysis on the `ooc_only.txt` output.
    2.  Use NLP techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to identify important keywords.
    3.  Cluster related keywords to identify broader topics (e.g., "rules questions," "scheduling," "last week's pizza order").
    4.  Present the results in a new "Social Insights" tab.

### Feature 3: Sound Event Detection

*   **Concept:** A feature to detect and annotate non-speech audio events in the transcript.
*   **User Value:** Adds richer context to the transcript. Knowing *why* everyone suddenly stopped talking (e.g., a fit of laughter) is valuable.
*   **Technical Approach:**
    1.  Integrate a pre-trained audio event detection model (e.g., YAMNet) into the pipeline.
    2.  Run this model over the audio to identify events like `[Laughter]`, `[Applause]`, `[Music]`, or `[Dice Rolling]`. 
    3.  Insert these events as annotations in the final transcript, like `[00:45:12] [Laughter] `.

## 4. New Visualization Concepts

These visualizations will use the "Gemini Constellation" theme to provide intuitive and beautiful data insights.

### Visualization 1: Speaker Constellation Graph

*   **Concept:** A dynamic network graph where each speaker is a glowing node. The node's size represents their total speaking time. Edges connect speakers who frequently interact, with the edge thickness representing the interaction frequency.
*   **UI:** An interactive canvas where users can drag nodes and see who drives the conversation.
*   **Implementation:** Use a JavaScript library like D3.js or Vis.js integrated into a Gradio HTML component.

### Visualization 2: Session Galaxy View

*   **Concept:** A scatter plot that visualizes the entire session as a "galaxy" of speech.
*   **UI:**
    *   **X-axis:** Session timeline.
    *   **Y-axis:** Can be toggled (e.g., sentiment score, speaking pace).
    *   **Points:** Each point is a speech segment, colored by speaker or by classification (IC vs. OOC). Hovering over a point shows the text.
*   **Value:** Provides an immediate, high-level understanding of the session's rhythm and flow.

### Visualization 3: Topic Nebula

*   **Concept:** A visually appealing word cloud, shaped like a nebula, generated from the OOC Keyword Analysis (Feature 2).
*   **UI:** The size of each word represents its frequency. The colors would be drawn from the "Gemini Constellation" data palette.
*   **Value:** A fun and shareable artifact that captures the social essence of the game session.

## 5. New Bug Detections (Non-Overlapping)

My review has uncovered the following bugs not mentioned by other agents:

### Bug 1: Unhandled Characters in Session ID

*   **Location:** `pipeline.py`, `formatter.py`
*   **Issue:** If a user enters a `session_id` in the UI with characters that are invalid for filenames (e.g., `My Session: 1` or `10/15/2025`), the application will crash when it tries to create files and directories with that name.
*   **Fix:** Implement a sanitization function that cleans the `session_id` for use in file paths, replacing invalid characters with an underscore.

### Bug 2: Unsafe Type Casting in Configuration

*   **Location:** `src/config.py`
*   **Issue:** The code loads settings from the `.env` file and casts them directly to integers (e.g., `int(os.getenv(...))`). If a user accidentally enters a non-numeric value (e.g., `CHUNK_LENGTH_SECONDS="abc"`), the application will raise a `ValueError` and crash on startup.
*   **Fix:** Wrap all `int()` casts in a `try-except ValueError` block and fall back to the default value if the cast fails, perhaps printing a warning to the console.
