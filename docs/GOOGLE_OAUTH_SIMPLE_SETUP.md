## Step 4: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

This tells Google who you are and what your app does.

1. In the left sidebar, click **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"OAuth consent screen"**

2. Select **"External"** as the User Type
   - (Even though it says "External", you're the only user)

## Step 5: Create OAuth Credentials (The Important Part!)

This creates the file you need.

1. In the left sidebar, click **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"Credentials"**

2. At the top, click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"**

3. Select **"OAuth client ID"**

4. For "Application type", select **"Desktop app"**

6. Click **"CREATE"**

7. A popup appears saying "OAuth client created"
   - **Click the "DOWNLOAD JSON" button** (or the download icon)
   - This downloads a file like `client_secret_123456.json`

8. Click **"OK"** to close the popup

---

## Step 6: Rename and Move the File

1. Find the file you just downloaded (probably in your Downloads folder)
   - It's named something like `client_secret_1234567890-abc123.apps.googleusercontent.com.json`

2. **Rename it to:** `gdrive_credentials.json`
   - Right-click ‚Üí Rename
   - Remove the entire old name
   - Type: `gdrive_credentials.json`

3. **Move it to your project folder:**
   - Cut the file (Ctrl+X)
   - Navigate to: `F:\Repos\VideoChunking\`
   - Paste it there (Ctrl+V)

4. **Verify it's in the right place:**
   - You should see `gdrive_credentials.json` next to `app.py` and `README.md`

---

## Step 7: Test It!

1. Start your app: `python app.py`

2. Go to the **"Document Viewer"** tab

3. Click **"üîê Authorize with Google"**

4. Your browser should open asking you to authorize

5. You'll see a warning that says "Google hasn't verified this app"
   - This is normal! YOU created this app, so it's safe
   - Click **"Advanced"**
   - Click **"Go to D&D Session Processor (unsafe)"**

6. Grant permission to access your Drive

7. Return to the app - you should see "Success!"

---

## Troubleshooting

### "credentials file not found"
- Make sure the file is named **exactly** `gdrive_credentials.json` (lowercase, no spaces)
- Make sure it's in `F:\Repos\VideoChunking\` (the root folder, not in a subfolder)

### "App hasn't been verified"
- This is normal for testing apps
- Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Go to [app name] (unsafe)"
- You created it, so it's safe!

### "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"
- Make sure you added yourself as a test user (Step 4, part 7)
- Make sure the Drive API is enabled (Step 3)

---

## Security Notes

- The `gdrive_credentials.json` file is in `.gitignore` (won't be committed to git)
- Your app only has **read-only** access (can't modify your files)
- You can revoke access anytime at: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
- Keep the app in "Testing" mode - you don't need to publish it

---

**That's it! Once you have the credentials file, the single-button OAuth will work perfectly.**
